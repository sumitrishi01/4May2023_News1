        <img src="./img/1.png"/>
        <p>Jammu and Kashmir is all set to host the third tourism working group meeting of G20 countries in capital Srinagar from Monday to Wednesday, with multi-tier security arrangements in place to successfully host its first major international event since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.</p>
        <p>The meeting, under India’s presidency, will be held at Sheri Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC) on the banks of the Dal Lake. More than 180 delegates, including 60 from G20 countries, are expected to attend the event.</p>
        <p>The senior IAS officer said that the key deliverables of the meeting are “Goa roadmap for tourism as a vehicle for achievable development goals” and G20 ministerial declaration. “The final meeting of G20 tourism ministers will be 
            held in Goa in June…In that context the meeting here assumes significance because the draft which will be adopted by ministers will be finalised in Srinagar,” Singh added.</p>

        <p>Nripendr Mishra, who was PM Modi's principal secretary in 2016 during demonetisation, claimed that PM Modi was never in favour of introducing R 2,000 notes as they are not suitable for daily transactions.

        <p>Commenting on Nripendra Mishra's remark that PM Modi never liked ₹2,000 notes, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said this is pathetic damage control. "Now he will say he was forced into demonetisation by his advisers," Jairam Ramesh said.</p>

        <p>Catania airport said flight operations were temporarily suspended because of the ashfall. INGV also warned that it had recorded evidence of a stepping up in tremor activity in recent days.</p>

        <p>Royal biographer Tom Bower said that the upkeep of the mansion and its land amounts is around £1million plus staffing costs.</p>
        <p>King Charles reportedly faces a potential royal family showdown over his decision to move Prince Andrew, his eldest brother, out of his

        home of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Frogmore Cottage. However, Prince Andrew is refusing to do so and is backed by members of the royal family as well.

        <img src="./img/10.png"/>
        <p>Is it 2016 again? Well, Virat Kohli is certainly making everyone feel that. Throughout IPL 2023, there were criticism about Kohli's strike rate and whether he still fits into the modern-day T20 batting. But as Chris Gayle said, “Never doubt Kohli”. On Sunday, with Royal Challengers Bangalore needing his services the most amid the battle for the final playoffs spot.</p>
        <p>Kohli smashed his second consecutive century this season to single-handedly fire the team to 197 for five. And with that knock followed a stunning reaction from wife Anushka Sharma and an incredible gesture from Gujarat Titans skipper Hardik Pandya. (RCB vs GT Live Score, IPL 2023)</p>
